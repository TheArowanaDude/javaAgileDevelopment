synopsis:  let's restructure the details

details: 

Please start with a short paragraph that reflects the understanding of what we are about to design, tell us about the game, the constraints, what we know about it.

Then, reference a UML diagram that is in a separate file. After that, write a short paragraph describing the overall design, give a big picture. Give reasons. Then dive into, in short paragraphs, with details about each class, their purpose, and reasons we choose to design them.
                                                    
Think about separation of concerns, what different responsibilities exist and where those should be.
